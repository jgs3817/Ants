Citizen Science - Machine learning to understand ant behaviour in the zoo

Eusocial insects have become model systems for studying emergence and swarm intelligence. Investigating the behaviour of social insects is often difficult, due to their sheer numbers and the complexity of the displayed behaviours. Modern machine learning and computer vision tools promise to overcome this limitation, by allowing for automated behavioural analyses, but they crucially rely on large labelled training data sets, which are currently unavailable. 
In our group, we have recently developed methods to identify and track individual ants in crowded foraging environments, and to estimate their weight; we are currently implementing simple task recognition. In order to provide the training data to power such methods, we are collaborating closely with a Zoological Garden in a Citizen Science-project: we have access to a large exhibition area, and we plan to supplement the exhibition with interactive touch screens which allow zoo visitors to help with both the generation of training data, and the validation of automated analyses. The task for the group will be to make first step in developing the software front-end for the interactive part of the exhibition, in particular the selection of individual ant workers performing certain tasks via touch screens, and the interaction with the large databases that run in the background, fed with the results from machine learning algorithms
